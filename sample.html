        <p>Despite their somewhat intimidating looks,<strong>Bala Sharks</strong> are considered to be gentle giants. They are relatively peaceful and get along well with a wide range of fish.

        <p>Red Tail Sharks have been <b><big>popular fish species in the aquarist community</big></b> for quite some time. There were originally found in freshwater lakes and swamps throughout Thailand. However, they are now considered to be critically endangered in the wild.</p>

        <img src="rainbow.jpg",height="200" width="150">
        <p>Rainbow Sharks generally aren’t recommended for beginning aquarists. The reason for that is aggression. These are very territorial fish that are known to attack other creatures in the tank. It’s an interesting behavioral trait that’s not usually found in the wild.</p>
